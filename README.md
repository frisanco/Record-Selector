# Record-Selector

This program searches my personal vinyl record collection and retrieves a list of 4 records for daily listening.

New features being added regularly!

Latest update:
  - Add filters for artist, album title, and year (year is functional, album title and artist still in progress)
  - Add ability to filter past recommendations (keep or discard)

Future updates:
  - Add ability to filter artist and album title
  - Add more focused filters for genres
  - Database integration to allow for larger datasets
  - Frontend mobile application
